<h3> first phase 2020 :</h3>
<p> When I graduated from uni I didnt know what i want to learn or to do especially that i spent around 4 years in collge in an unpleaset dep wich is politics.
    that major was never in my thoughts but my grades in high school forced me to go for it. however, elhamdullah i should be grafte that allah helped me to be fluent in english so ,
    i worked with multinational companies then i'm now teaching engish untill i learn this front-end path insha'allah.
     yea sometimes i companin about work cuz i don't get paid alot and i don't like chating and teaching at all. but yea i hope i will be happy very soon. so there was a friend of mine was learning programming and advised me to try .
     so i tried and strted with html but it was at time very boring and i needed money that time and wantedto work asp to earn money and this path i knew  you had to spend much time to start earn money from it so i waasn't patient and i quit.
